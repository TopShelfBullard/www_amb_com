Homepage for A. Mitchell Bullard
=====================

This is just a bit of web development practice. I will be working with PHP and LESS  for the first time
(I'm used to Rails and SASS), and I hope to become more familiar with the upcoming version of
Bootstrap. An added benefit will be coming out the other side unscathed with a personal website.
