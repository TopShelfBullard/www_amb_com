      <h2>HTML/CSS</h2>
        <p>
          Like most aspiring software/web developers, A. Mitchell Bullard began his journey with simple HTML and CSS. Within a month,
          he was neck deep in CSS 3D transforms and animations. During this time he found a great love for web design. While pushing
          the limits of markup and style, as well as the limits of his own skill, he experienced the soaring highs and the epic disasters that we
          all love about web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, A. Mitchell Bullard is a more seasoned, battle-hardened HTML/CSS-slinger, and combining
          all that he learned from his many failures and successes with some Bootstrap 3, a helping of server side pizzazz, a side dish of
          JavaScript and friends, and dash of LESS or SASS for acceleration, A. Mitchell Bullard ready to mold his passion for web development
          into a career.
