           <h4>Your journey begins soon.</h4>
          <p>
            Follow Alexander Wright as he is torn from his junior high life in Minneapolis. Travel with him to a new world,
            The Creitium Anivis, where an epic adventure awaits. Learn the art of wizardry alongside Alexander and his
            two new friends, Arac and Gram, and practice your newfound skill on the fly against the firestorm of opposition
            between you and your goal.
          </p>
          <p>
            What is your goal? You have two directions etched upon your hand in a forbidden language that you shouldn't
            understand by a man that you do not know, a man who screams in the dark of night:
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            Your destiny waits far to the north. Listen to your dreams.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will require every brushstroke of your creativity, every fiber of your strength, every scrap of your intellect
            when these dreams stop and you find yourself lost in a wilderness controlled by your greatest fear:
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            The Shadow of Despair.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your journey begins soon, exclusively on Amazon.
