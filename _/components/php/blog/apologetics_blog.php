    Anyone enjoy a good debate?
</p>
<p>
    Good, 'cause that's what this blog is all about. If you are a Catholic who wants to see a fellow
    member of the Body of Christ defend the faith, an anti-catholic who wants to debate
    one of the Catholic faithful in a public forum, or you just like seeing a good conflict, this
    may just be the blog for you.

    I will blog the truth, and, if I can find anyone interested, I will post email debates. So put on
    your gauntlets, gather your well corroborated scientific, historical, and theological facts
    (logic and common sense are also prerequisites), and come battle with or against the Servant
    of Truth.
