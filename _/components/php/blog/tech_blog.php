<p>
    All things tech are fair game in this geeky student/professional blog. I'll muse upon my own
    education (formal as well as the hard-knock school of 'Just Jump In and Figure It Out Yourself'),
    and I will drop advice for other students to take or discard.
</p>
<p>
    As a new member of the professional programming community, I'll also drop some gems for
    the geek tying to become more employable as well as the veteran employed who has forgotten
    the awesomeness of what they are paid to do.
</p>

<p>It should be awesome... and code heavy.</p>
