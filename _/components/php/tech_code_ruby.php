<h3>Ruby</h3>
<p>
  As a young developer I was told stories of a magical language where all that that a developer would have to do is consider
  opening a text editor and they will have inadvertently created fifteen objects and replaced three hundred lines of code
  with a handful of words separated by dots. Initially I dismissed this as merely fanciful bedtime stories that our professors used
  to calm us after epic debugging sessions, but then I met Ruby.

  Ruby is the first language that forced me to confront objects head on, and I am very thankful that I met the challenge because
  I now have a firm understanding of the concepts of object oriented programming. Just taking into account the principles of
  abstraction and encapsulation, this will make me a better programmer, no matter what the language, IDE, or problem in need of
  solving.

  I soon moved on to Ruby on Rails, where the learning curve for me was steep indeed. Rails was my first exposure the the MVC
  pattern, as well as the first time I left the client side to see how good the view was from the server. Configuration tied me up for
  awhile, and I am ashamed to admit that I spoke very uncharitable words to the poor Ruby Gems in my GEMFILE. All of that
  is in the rear view mirror now, though, and a summer of Rails development has earned me a great deal of useful bonus knowledge,
  such as working with MySQL and git. Ruby on Rails has been a great experience so far, and I am very excited about the release of
  my first Rails web app, "Nerdwords," which you can check out by clicking the 'app' link above.
