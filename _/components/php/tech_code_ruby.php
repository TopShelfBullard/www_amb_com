<h3>Ruby</h3>
                  <p>
                    As a young developer I was told stories of a magical language where all that that a developer would have to do is consider
                    opening a text editor and they will have inadvertently created fifteen objects and replaced three hundred lines of code
                    with a handful of words separated by dots. Initially I dismissed this as merely fanciful bedtime stories that our professors
                    used to calm us after epic debugging sessions, but then I met Ruby.

                    Ruby is the first language that forced me to confront objects head on, and I am very thankful that I met the challenge
                    because I now have a firm understanding of the concepts involved with object oriented programming. Just taking into
                    account the principles of abstraction and encapsulation, this will make me a better programmer, no matter what the
                    language, IDE, or problem in need of solving.

                    I soon moved on to Ruby on Rails, where the learning curve for me was steep indeed. Rails was my first exposure to the
                    MVC pattern, as well as the first time that I left the client side to see how good the view was from the server. Configuration
                    tied me up for a while, and I am ashamed to admit that I spoke many uncharitable words to the poor Ruby Gems in my
                    GEMFILE. All of that is in the rear view mirror now, though, and after a summer of Rails development, I am working on my
                    first serious web app and I have recently agreed to take over the web master duties for the Chippewa Valley Habitat for
                    Humanities.

                    Currently, I have decided to take a big step back, though, into plain old Ruby. In order to understand Rails and OOP more fully, I
                    have taken to solving some of the programming tasks on <a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Programming_Tasks">
                    Rosetta Code. </a>
                    This has been very fun for me, and rather soon I should be able to provide a link to an A. Mitchell Bullard Rosetta Code submission
                    as well as a Github repository.
