<h3>Ruby</h3>
<p>
  As a young developer I was told stories of a magical language where all that that a developer would have to do is consider
  opening a text editor and they will have inadvertently created fifteen objects and replaced three hundred lines of code
  with a handful of words separated by dots. Initially I dismissed this as merely fanciful bedtime stories that our professors
  used to calm us after epic debugging sessions, but then I met Ruby.

<p>
  Ruby is the first language that forced me to confront objects head on, and I am very thankful that I met the challenge
  because I now have a firm understanding of the concepts involved with object oriented programming. Just taking into
  account the principles of abstraction and encapsulation, this will make me a better programmer, no matter what the
  language, IDE, or problem in need of solving.

  I soon moved on to Ruby on Rails, where the learning curve for me was steep indeed. Rails was my first exposure to the
  MVC pattern, as well as the first time that I left the client side to see how good the view was from the server. Configuration
  tied me up for a while, and I am ashamed to admit that I spoke many uncharitable words to the poor Ruby Gems in my
  GEMFILE. All of that is in the rear view mirror now, though, and after a summer of Rails development, I am working on my
  first serious web app and I have recently agreed to take over the web master duties for the Chippewa Valley Habitat for
  Humanities.
