<h3>C#</h3>
<p>   
  I am enrolled in a .NET course at Chippewa Valley Technical College for the next eight weeks, and we are learning Visual Basic.
  My initial master plan is to complete each class assignment two times,
  once in Visual Basic and once in C#&mdash;maybe a third time in Ruby to keep my skills up (if the semester doesn't get too crazy).
  I say this is my initial plan because if this class progresses the way that I expect it to, halfway through the semester I will most
  likely begin to work on some more advanced programs in my free time instead of those that we are assigned.

  Keep an eye on the tech/projects/C# section of amitchellbullard.com, or my Github account, for an upcoming C# project 
  that I hope some of you out there will work with me on.
