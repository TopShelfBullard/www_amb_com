    The first installment A. Mitchell Bullard's explosive fantasy series,
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mystery-Magical-Journeys-Alexander-ebook/dp/B0083YU4II/ref=cm_sw_em_r_dp_2HUfsb0X00Q24_tt">
      The Many Magical Journeys of Alexander Wright
    </a>,
    is currently available at Amazon's Kindle store. In this epic debut, the line between dreams-come-true and living-nightmares
    blurs to the point of indistinction, the love and hate that binds friends and enemies crumbles to dust, and home is replaced by a
    vast wilderness of beauty, wonder, and horror.
