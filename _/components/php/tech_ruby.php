<h3>Ruby</h3>
<p>
  As a young developer I was told stories of a magical language where all that that a developer would have to do is consider
  opening a text editor and they will have inadvertently created fifteen objects and replaced three hundred lines of code
  with a handful of words separated by dots. Initially I dismissed this as merely fanciful bedtime stories that our professors used
  to calm us after epic debugging sessions, but then I met Ruby.

  Ruby is the first language that forced me to confront objects head on, and I am very thankful that I met the challenge because
  I now have a firm understanding of the concepts of object oriented programming. Actually, partially due to good instincts and
  partially due to great instruction, I wrote much of my JavaScript code with the principles of encapsulation and abstraction in mind,
  so the transition to OOP seemed quite natural.
