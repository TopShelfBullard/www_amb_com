<h3>Nerdwords</h3> 
                  <p> 
                    Nerdwords began as a fun program to write with Ruby on Rails this summer. I was waylaid by some other web development
                    that came up, so it currently looks rather incomplete and sad. I hope to plug away at it throughout the next
                    couple months and have something really cool by winter.

                    Nerdwords  is to be a word game assistant of epic proportion. Put in your scrabble letters, as well as the letter that you
                    want to play off of, and Nerdwords will give you your options. It will solve the missing piece of a crossword puzzle,
                    it will complete entire word searches... I most likely haven't even thought of what its coolest feature will be yet.

                    Initially I set Nerdwords up to query a database, but while at

                    over the summer, a professional said that he would use a search api. I will most likely heed that advice, but I also plan
                    to look into a binary tree, because binary trees look wicked awesome. I am always interested in learning how to create
                    awesomeness with my brain and my text editor.
