<h3>Java</h3>
                  <p>
                    From what I understand, we finally broke the light barrier. A small group of Sun engineers
                    called the "Green Team" created this programming language in the mid 90's, and if you
                    develop in it, your program will go faster than light, making the value for time in Einstien's
                    Relativity equations dip below zero. That's right, Java is the flux capacitor of modern
                    development. Sure, it takes:
                    <br><br>
                    public class JustDoNothingAtAll {
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main(String[] args) {
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;}
                    <br>
                    }
                    <br><br>                  
                  <p>
                    just to write an error-free Java program that does nothing (Copyright &copy;

                    but there is always a trade-off if you want time-bending performance.

                    To be honest, I was absolutely prepared to dislike the Java programming language, coming
                    off a summer of Ruby development in Vim. I tentatively crept into Eclipse as if it were a snake
                    pit teaming with king cobras, winced as I turned the first page of my 800,000 page Java textbook,
                    and soon found, to my surprise, that Java is totally awesome (although starting to use

                    rather than Eclipse for my Java development is definitely on my to-do list, as is jumping into a bit of

                    Currently, I am still working through my first Java course in school (and loving it), and I am
                    also heavy into Java at my internship right now. I have a few Java project ideas on the back
                    burner that I am itching to get into once the sun sets upon this busy semester. If you're curious
                    about them, check out the contact page to find my github account and watch the repositories.
                    At least one of these projects will appear soon.
