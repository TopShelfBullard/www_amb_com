<h3>JavaScript</h3>
                  <p>
                    Ahh, JavaScript, the language that insists an array of one, two, three, and four is not equal to an array of one, two, three
                    and four... although ten quadrillion is, in fact, equal to ten quadrillion and one. Isn't it amazing that in merely ten days,
                    Brendan Eich of Netscape won the race against Microsoft to develop a language with the power to rob a computer of its
                    ability to understand equality? I hear the kids are using JavaScript all over the place these days. The statisticians are saying
                    that there is a new JavaScript library released like every 7.3 seconds and I think NASA just announced a plan rewrite all of
                    their software for the space shuttles in jQuery.

                    I enjoy making fun of JavaScript, but I must admit that it was a programming fundamentals course with a spectacular professor
                    and none other that plain old JavaScript that initially hooked me on programming. At the time I did little else other than work
                    on JavaScript and by the end of the eight week course I was working comfortably with the DOM, experimenting with OOP, and
                    beginning to branch out into jQuery.

                  <p>
                    I still enjoy JavaScript very much, in fact, I am currently writing a small web app in jQuery for my children that will help them
                    learn great moments in history, literature, and music without realizing that they are studying. I have also begun a daily
                    JavaScript class for my daughter.
