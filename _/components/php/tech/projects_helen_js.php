                    My daughter, Helen, is nine-years-old. One day last semester she sat down and worked on a JavaScript
                    unit about loops with me. Somehow she totally understood it. Since she seemed to enjoy programming with me, and
                    since she was able to understand JavaScript loops at nine (when half my class didn't), I've been teaching her some JavaScript
                    here and there. She loves it, and now she's working on writing her own site.

                    We decided the go ahead and turn HTML/CSS/JavaScript class with daddy into a daily thing. As long as she is having
                    fun, we'll keep rolling on it. Who knows, maybe I'll even link some of her work here... Nah, we'll just set her up with a
                    Github account.
