<h3>JavaScript</h3>
  <p>
    Ahh, JavaScript, the language that insists an array of one, two, three, and four is not equal to an array of one, two, three
    and four... although ten quadrillion is, in fact, equal to ten quadrillion and one. Isn't it amazing that in merely ten days,
    Brendan Eich of Netscape won the race against Microsoft to develop a language with the power to rob a computer of its
    ability to understand equality? I hear the kids are using JavaScript all over the place these days. The statisticians are saying
    that there is a new JavaScript library released like every 7.3 seconds and I think NASA just announced a plan rewrite all of
    their software for the space shuttles in jQuery.

    I enjoy making fun of JavaScript, but I must admit that it was a programming fundamentals course with a spectacular professor
    and none other that plain old JavaScript that initially hooked me on programming. At the time I did little else other than work
    on JavaScript and by the end of the eight week course I was working comfortably with the DOM, experimenting with OOP, and
    beginning to branch out into jQuery. I still enjoy JavaScript very much, and I recently wrote a little web app called "The Revisionist"
    that you can check out by clicking the 'app' link above.
