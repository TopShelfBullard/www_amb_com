                  "Never knowing what to expect when downloading a free book I have to say that was very happily
                  surprised with this book. If you enjoyed Harry Potter you should love this book too. I'm not going to
                  say that it is a totally believable storyline, Alexander is far too philosophical for any 12 year old, but
                  isn't that part of entering into the world created by an author? Good versus evil; becoming more then
                  you ever dreamed you could be; classic fantasy. Looking forward to following Alexander on his many
                  magical adventures."
