                    My daughter, Helen, is nine-years-old. One day last semester she sat down and worked on a JavaScript
                    unit about loops with me. Somehow she totally understood it. Since she seemed to enjoy programming
                    with me, and since she was able to understand JavaScript loops at nine (when half my class didn't), I've
                    began to teach her a bit of JavaScript. She loved it, began working on a project, and then attended

                      Camp 15</a> with me.

                    At code camp, we sat down and started hacking on Ruby. She had a blast, so we've decided to switch gears,
                    and jump right into daily Ruby class. As long as she continues to enjoy code, we'll keep working on it and I'll
                    have a little code camp buddy. Who knows, maybe I'll even link some of her work here... Nah, we'll
                    just set her up with a Github account.
