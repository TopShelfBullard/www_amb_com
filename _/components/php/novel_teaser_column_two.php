  blood-red directions upon the back of your hand in a forbidden language that you shouldn't understand:
</p>               
<blockquote>
  Your destiny waits far to the north. Listen to your dreams.
</blockquote>                
<p>
  You will require every brushstroke of your creativity, every fiber of your strength, every scrap of your intellect when these
  dreams stop and you find yourself lost in a wilderness controlled by your greatest fear...
