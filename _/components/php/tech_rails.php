<h3>Ruby on Rails</h3>            
<p>
  I soon moved on to Ruby on Rails, where the learning curve for me was steep indeed. Rails was my first exposure the the MVC
  pattern, as well as the first time I left the client side to see how good the view was from the server. Configuration tied me up for
  awhile, and I am ashamed to admit that I spoke very uncharitable words to the poor Ruby Gems in my GEMFILE. All of that
  is in the rear view mirror now, though, and a summer of Rails development has earned me a great deal of useful bonus knowledge,
  such as working with MySQL and git. Ruby on Rails has been a great experience so far, and I am very excited about the release of
  my first Rails web app, "Nerdwords," which you can check out by clicking the 'app' link above.
