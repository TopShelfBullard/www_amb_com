                I recently designed, developed, and deployed a website using HTML5, CSS3 (via LESS), PHP,
                and Twitter Bootstrap 3. I am also the new web master for Chippewa Valley Habitat for
                Humanity.

                I controlled the flow of millions of dollars worth of fluctuating inventory in and out of our
                warehouse, and organized teams of my fellow employees to perform systematic cycle counts
                in preparation for yearly internal and external inventory audits. I also performed frequent
                quality checks on a product where poor quality could mean the loss of lives.

                I ran a locater for a directional bore machine in high pressure situations where one mistake
                could bankrupt my employers. Locating takes a very abstract mind and a great affinity for
                problem solving.

                As a Crew Leader I delivered and installed high-end appliances in wealthy Twin Cities
                Neighborhoods. Simultaneously functioning as a manager to my crew helper and a customer
                service rep to a customer while in that customerâ€™s home is partially what molded me into the
                man that my coworkers enjoy working with today.
