    The first week of November 2013 I started at JAMF Software as a software development intern
    for the plug-in team, where I have the spectacular opportunity to test and develop plug-ins
    for the Casper Suite. I was the sole developer working on a minor release of the Altiris plugin,
    and added many new features, greatly improved the test coverage, completely reworked the build
    process along side the Dev Ops team, and fixed multiple defects.

    I recently designed, developed, and deployed a website using HTML5, CSS3 (via LESS), JavaScript, PHP,
    and Bootstrap 3. I am also training to be the new web master for Chippewa Valley
    Habitat for Humanity.
