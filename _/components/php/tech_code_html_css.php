<h3>HTML/CSS</h3>
<p>
  HTML and CSS&mdash;where some developers choose to organize their content and style and others choose to design 
  something more akin to the tangled nest of power cords behind an entertainment system. Few have found a method to
  strengthen one's patience that can hope to rival the experience of witnessing four browsers render your flawless code
  like infants who stumbled upon a box of markers.

  Luckily for me, as a father of five, I have more than enough patience to deal with four unruly browsers&mdash;and I always enjoy
  a good challenge. Actually, I have had a blast learning HTML and CSS. I designed the site that you see here as an excuse to
  research Bootstrap 3 and LESS. During the development of this site I came to a much greater understanding of mobile first
  and responsive design, I dug into the Bootstrap 3 code and learned the techniques of creating a fluid grid so that I could alter
  it to better fit my project, and I gained the practical experience of compiling code with CodeKit and deploying on Heroku.
