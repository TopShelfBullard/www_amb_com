    Software and web development, epic storytelling, music composition&mdash;these are amazing creative outlets for a motivated, thoughtful
    individual such as A. Mitchell Bullard, but the true joy in his life are the people that he is blessed to share them with. While pursuing a bachelor's
    degree in music at Viterbo University in LaCrosse, WI, the love of his life, Carrie, asked him out on a date. Since then she has become his wife
    and given him the five greatest gifts that he has ever received: Helen Marie, Harrison Michael, Julian Charles, Marian Gianna, and Jonathan Paul.
